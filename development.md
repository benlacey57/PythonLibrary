Python Utility Library Framework Plan
Let me help you design a solid foundation for your utility library. This approach will create reusable, maintainable components following SOLID and DRY principles.
Core Architecture Components
1. Base Classes and Interfaces

BaseService: Abstract class implementing common functionality (logging, error handling)
Configurable: Interface for classes that need configuration
Authenticatable: Interface for services requiring authentication

2. Configuration Management

ConfigManager: Handles loading from JSON or environment files
CredentialsManager: Secures API keys, passwords with encryption/decryption
EnvLoader: Specifically for loading .env variables

3. Data Handling

DataProcessor: Interface for data transformation operations
DataValidator: Validation rules implementation
DataExporter: For various output formats (CSV, JSON, etc.)

Service-Specific Implementations
Storage & Caching

RedisClient: Connection pooling, key management, serialization
FileManager: File operations with proper error handling
GoogleDriveService: Upload, download, permissions management

Analytics & Marketing

GoogleAdsClient: Campaign data, reporting
GoogleAnalyticsClient: Site metrics, user behavior
GoogleSearchConsoleClient: SEO data, performance metrics

Content Management

WordPressClient: Post management, media, settings
ImageOptimizer: Resize, compress, format conversion

AI Services

ClaudeAIClient: Text generation, classification
OpenAIClient: Model interaction, response processing

Data Collection

WebScraper: Configurable scraping with respect for robots.txt
SEOAuditor: Site analysis, recommendations

Reporting

ReportGenerator: Interface for report creation
HTMLReportBuilder: HTML report implementation
PDFReportBuilder: PDF generation with customization

Infrastructure

DatabaseClient: Connection pooling, query building
WebhookManager: Register, trigger, process webhooks
LogManager: Configurable logging to files/services

Implementation Guidelines

Directory Structure:
```
/src
  /core
    /interfaces
    /base
    /config
  /services
    /storage
    /analytics
    /ai
    /web
  /utils
/tests
  /unit
  /integration
```

Logging Strategy:

Centralized through LogManager
Configurable levels
Rotation policies
Context preservation


Error Handling:

Custom exception hierarchy
Consistent error codes
Automatic logging


Testing Approach:

Mock interfaces for external services
Configuration fixtures
Integration test suite with sample data

Core Components
Configuration and Environment
The library uses a combination of JSON configuration files and environment variables (.env) to manage settings:

Configuration is loaded hierarchically, allowing project-specific overrides
Sensitive information is stored in .env files or encrypted within configuration
The ConfigManager provides a unified interface for accessing all settings

Logging and Monitoring
Comprehensive logging is built into all components:

All logs are centralized through the LogManager
API calls are tracked with request/response details in CSV format
Method execution can be monitored with decorators for timing and logging
Rich console integration provides visual feedback for CLI applications

Extension System
The library supports a WordPress-like extension mechanism:

Core functionality can be extended without modifying the original code
Configuration inheritance allows selective overriding of settings
Custom implementations can be loaded dynamically at runtime

Service Categories
Storage Services

FileClient - File system operations
GoogleDriveClient - Google Drive integration
DropboxClient - Dropbox integration

Database and Caching

DatabaseClient - SQL database operations
RedisClient - Redis operations
CachingService - Caching implementations (memory, file, database)

Google Services

GoogleSheetsClient - Spreadsheet operations
GoogleSlidesClient - Presentation operations
GoogleAnalyticsClient - Analytics data
GoogleSearchConsoleClient - Search performance data
GoogleAdsClient - Advertising data
GoogleCalendarClient - Calendar management

AI Integration

OpenAIClient - OpenAI API integration
ClaudeAIClient - Claude AI API integration

Media Processing

ImageService - Image manipulation and optimization

Web Services

WordPressClient - WordPress API integration
WebScraperService - Web scraping
SEOService - SEO analysis
WebhookService - Webhook handling

Communication

SMTPClient - Email delivery
BufferClient - Social media scheduling
SSHClient - Remote command execution

Utilities

ConsoleService - Rich console integration
ReportingService - Report generation (HTML, PDF)
DataValidationService - Data validation utilities

Development Approach
This library follows Test-Driven Development (TDD) practices:

Tests are written before implementation
Components are built incrementally in logical phases
Each component has both unit and integration tests
Documentation is maintained alongside code

Basic Configuration
```
from core.config import ConfigManager

# Load configuration with project-specific overrides
config = ConfigManager('/home/{user}/scripts/python/{project_name}/config/')
api_key = config.get('google.api_key')
```

Google Sheets Integration
```
from services.google import GoogleSheetsClient
from core.config import ConfigManager

config = ConfigManager()
sheets = GoogleSheetsClient(config)

# Read data from a spreadsheet
data = sheets.read_range('spreadsheet_id', 'Sheet1!A1:C10')

# Write data to a spreadsheet
sheets.write_range('spreadsheet_id', 'Sheet1!A1', [['Name', 'Email', 'Score']])
```

Image Processing
```
from services.media import ImageService

image_service = ImageService()

# Resize an image
image_service.resize('input.jpg', 'output.jpg', width=800, maintain_aspect=True)

# Convert format
image_service.convert_format('input.jpg', 'output.webp', quality=85)

# Optimize an image
image_service.optimize('input.jpg', 'optimized.jpg', target_size=200_000)
```
