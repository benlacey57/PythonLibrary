# Python Library
A series of custom python classes to help with routine tasks for other projects.

# Installation
To install this python library locally we can use pip:

```
pip install -e /path/to/my_package
```

The `-e` flag installs in "editable" mode, which means changes to your source code will be reflected immediately without needing to reinstall.

Once installed, you can import your package in any Python script.

```python
import python_library
from python_library import core.config
from python_library import core.base.base_client
```
